## 📖 Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard was designed to track key performance indicators (KPIs) and operational metrics for **Amante's**, a local coffee shop business.

The primary objective of this project was to transition the business from intuition-based management to data-driven decision-making. By visualizing Point of Sale (POS) data, this dashboard provides actionable insights into customer purchasing behavior, peak operational hours, and menu performance, allowing stakeholders to optimize inventory, staffing, and marketing strategies.

## 📊 Key Features

### 1. Executive KPI Monitoring
A consolidated view of critical financial and operational metrics to track business health at a glance:
- **Net Sales:** Real-time revenue tracking after discounts.
- **Average Order Value (AOV):** Monitoring transaction size to gauge customer spending power.
- **Operational Volume:** Tracking the average quantity of items per transaction.
- **Discount Efficiency:** Monitoring the "Total Discount Given" percentage to ensure promotions are not eroding margins.

### 2. Customer Preference Profiling
Granular analysis of product customizations to drive inventory planning and menu development:
- **Sweetness & Spice Levels:** Analyzing customer requests (e.g., Sugar 25% vs. 50%, Spicy vs. Mild) to standardize recipes and reduce waste.
- **Flavor Popularity:** Breakdown of preferred appetizer flavors (Sour Cream, Cheese, BBQ, etc.).
- **Dessert Sizing:** Tracking the ratio of Solo, Duo, Medio, Familia servings to inform portion control.

### 3. Operational & Staffing Intelligence
- **Store Performance by Hour:** A line chart identifying peak traffic times to optimize staff scheduling and shift rotation.
- **Dine-in vs. Takeaway:** Analyzes the fulfillment channel mix to assess seating capacity requirements.
- **Payment Method Analysis:** Breakdowns of Cash, GCash, and Credit/Debit usage to streamline checkout processes.

### 4. Product Performance
- **Category & Sub-Category Analysis:** Drill-down capabilities into specific groups (Coffee Based, Milk Based, Pastries, Rice Meals) to identify best-sellers and slow-moving items.

### 5. Dynamic Filtering
- **Interactive Slicers:** Users can filter the entire report by **Week Number**, **Month Name**, and **Day of the Week** to isolate specific trends and seasonal anomalies.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Visualization:** Microsoft Power BI
- **Data Cleaning & Modeling:** Power Query
- **Calculations:** DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

## 💡 Business Insights (Example Scenarios)

- **Staffing Optimization:** The "Performance by Hour" chart reveals peak demand windows, allowing management to schedule extra baristas specifically during those high-volume hours.
- **Inventory Management:** "Appetizer Flavor Preference" data helps in forecasting stock requirements for specific seasonings, preventing stockouts of popular flavors like Cheese or Sour Cream.
- **Menu Engineering:** "Sweetness Preference" data suggests standardizing recipes to the most common request (e.g., 50%) to improve workflow efficiency.
